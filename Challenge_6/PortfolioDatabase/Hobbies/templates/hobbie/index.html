            <p class="lead my-3">I am a passionate Computer Science student with a deep enthusiasm for technology 
                and innovation! Currently, I am a Weber State University student scheduled to graduate Fall 2025. 
                From coding my first program to exploring complex algorithms, I’ve always been driven by the endless possibilities. 
                My journey in CS isn’t just about writing code, it’s about making an impact, learning continuously, and shaping the 
                future with technology. Beyond programming, I believe in the importance of giving back to the community and helping others.</p>
